# Stock0 
A stock app designed to track and compare stocks realtime!
I have been looking into free stock APIs. I have found a bunch but I am unsure of what they each refer to. I have seen some APIS with the name JSON at their end. Would be wise to discuss with John regarding this.
Some of the free API websites that  have found are: Finazon, Twelve Data, Alpha Vantage, MarketStack.
